            this.m_Interpretation = "The use of monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and panitumumab has significantly expanded the treatment " +
                "options for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).  These agents, when used alone or in combination with chemotherapy, selectively inhibit " +
                "the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and thus prevent activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway that drives tumor growth and progression.  Recent " +
                "studies have demonstrated that 35 to 45% of metastatic colorectal cancers harbor oncogenic point mutations in codons 12 or 13 of the KRAS gene, " +
                "resulting in constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway.  Tumors with KRAS mutations exhibit resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and are " +
                "associated with shorter progression-free and overall survival.  Therefore, testing for KRAS point mutations in codons 12 and 13 provides useful " +
                "prognostic information and allows for individualized treatment of patients with metastatic CRC.\r\n\r\n" +
                "An STA product indicative of a KRAS mutation was not detected by high resolution capillary electrophoresis, indicating that the patient has a " +
                "metastatic CRC that may respond to anti-EGFR therapy.";

			this.m_Method = "DNA was first extracted from the patient’s paraffin-embedded specimen using an automated DNA extraction system.  KRAS " +
			    "allele-specific PCR was then performed on the patient’s sample and on positive and negative controls.  The products generated from this reaction " +
			    "were then subjected to a second PCR step employing fluorescently-labeled nucleotides and primers designed to detect both mutant and wild-type forms " +
			    "of the KRAS gene.  Utilizing a procedure similar to traditional DNA sequencing, termed the SHIFTED TERMINATION ASSAY (STA), the presence of any of " +
			    "the 12 KRAS point mutations causes termination of complementary DNA chain synthesis during amplification.  Thus, complementary DNA strands are " +
			    "formed with lengths that are specific to the particular KRAS point mutation present.  The products of the STA reaction were analyzed using " +
			    "high-resolution capillary electrophoresis to detect the presence of DNA fragments indicative of a KRAS mutation.";
