                "accounts for approximately 80% of all thyroid cancers.  The BRAF gene, a member of the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway that drives tumor growth and progression, " +
                "has been found to play a pivotal role in PTC oncogenesis.  Recent studies have shown that approximately 40% of PTC's harbor a point mutation in codon 600 " +
                "of the BRAF gene, resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid for valine in the encoded protein.  This alteration results in constitutive activation of " +
                "the BRAF protein kinase, and thus, the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway.  Testing for the BRAF V600E/K mutation in thyroid samples is useful both for diagnosis and " +
                "for risk stratification in order to guide clinical operative decision making.  Among all thyroid neoplasms, studies have shown that BRAF V600E/K mutations " +
                "occur almost exclusively in PTC.  This characteristic is useful in the diagnosis of lesions that are suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, PTC on histology " +
                "or fine needle aspirates.  Furthermore, PTC's that harbor a BRAF V600E/K mutation exhibit more aggressive clinicopathologic features including " +
                "extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, high-risk histology, advanced disease stage, and greater risk for persistence and recurrence.  Knowledge of " +
                "the patient's BRAF gene status may therefore confer important prognostic information and allow for more individualized treatment of patients with PTC.  High " +
                "resolution capillary electrophoresis detected a 107-base product indicative of a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus indicating that the patient has a PTC that may " +
                "exhibit a more aggressive clinical behavior.";
